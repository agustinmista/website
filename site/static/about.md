# About me

<div class="justified">
I'm a Ph.D. student at the Computer Science and Engineering department of [Chalmers
University of Technology](https://chalmers.se) in Sweden, under the supervision
of [Alejandro Russo](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo). Previously, I received
a Licentiate Degree in Computer Science at the [National University of
Rosario](https://unr.edu.ar) in Argentina.

My research lies in the intersection of functional programming and software
security. In particular, I'm focused on developing automatic testing tools by
exploiting the rich information encoded in strongly-typed programs. 

I'm a part of the [Octopi](https://octopi.chalmers.se) project, a platform for
secure programming IoT devices using functional programming. Additionally, I'm a
collaborator of [QuickFuzz](https://github.com/CIFASIS/QuickFuzz), a grammar
fuzzer written in Haskell that discovered a bunch of zero-day vulnerabilities on
web browsers and image processing libraries, among others.
