    <h2>About me</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    I'm a Ph.D. student at the Computer Science and Engineering department of
    <a href="https://chalmers.se">Chalmers University of Technology</a> in
    Sweden, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo">Alejandro Russo</a>.
    Previously, I received a Licentiate Degree in Computer Science at the
    <a href="https://unr.edu.ar">National University of Rosario</a> in Argentina.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research lies in the intersection of functional programming and software
    security. In particular, Iâ€™m focused on developing automatic testing tools
    by exploiting the rich information encoded in strongly-typed programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a part of the <a href="https://octopi.chalmers.se">Octopi</a> project, a
    platform for secure programming IoT devices using functional programming.
    Additionally, I'm a collaborator of
    <a href="https://github.com/CIFASIS/QuickFuzz">QuickFuzz</a>, a grammar fuzzer
    written in Haskell that discovered a bunch of zero-day vulnerabilities on
    web browsers and image processing libraries, among others.
