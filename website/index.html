    <h2>About me</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    Hej! I'm a software engineer based in Sweden.
  </p>

  <p>
    My weapon of choice is Haskell, but I also regularly get hurt messing with
    C, TypeScript, and Python. I'm currently working at the CI/CD division of
    <a href="https://zenseact.com">Zenseact</a>. Before that, I worked for
    <a href="https://dpella.io">DPella</a>, helping develop their first pilot
    solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from
    <a href="https://chalmers.se">Chalmers University of Technology</a>, where I
    conducted <a href="/pubs">my research</a> under the guidance of
    <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo">Alejandro Russo</a>. Before
    that, I received a Licentiate Degree in Computer Science from the
    <a href="https://unr.edu.ar">National University of Rosario</a>.
  </p>


  <p>
    Sometimes I also write about <a href="/blog">random stuff</a>.
