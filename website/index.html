    <h2>About me</h2>
  </header>

  <p>Hej! I'm a software engineer based in Sweden.</p>

  <p>
    My weapons of choice are <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
    and <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>, but I also have experience with a
    variety of other languages and tools. My professional interests include
    automated testing, programming languages design and implementation, digital
    electronics, low-level programming, web development, among many others.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from
    <a href="https://chalmers.se">Chalmers University of Technology</a>, where I
    conducted <a href="/pubs">my research</a> under the guidance of
    <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo">Alejandro Russo</a>. Before
    that, I received a Licentiate Degree in Computer Science from the
    <a href="https://unr.edu.ar">National University of Rosario</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently working as a Haskell engineer at
    <a href="https://tweag.io">Tweag</a> (part of
    <a href="https://moduscreate.com">Modus Create</a>) on highly-specialized
    projects. Previously, I focused on developing reproducible build
    environments at
    <a href="https://zenseact.com">Zenseact</a> and worked at
    <a href="https://dpella.io">DPella</a>, where I helped develop the pilot
    version of their custom
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy">differentially-private</a>
    programming language.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also write about <a href="/blog">random stuff</a> sometimes. Not as much
    as I'd like, though.
