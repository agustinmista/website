    <h2>About me</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    Hej! I'm a software engineer based in Sweden.
  </p>

  <p>
    My weapons of choice are Haskell and Nix, but I also have experience with
    a variety of other languages and tools. My professional interests include
    automated testing, programming languages design and implementation, digital
    electronics, low-level programming, web development, among many others.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from
    <a href="https://chalmers.se">Chalmers University of Technology</a>, where I
    conducted <a href="/pubs">my research</a> under the guidance of
    <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo">Alejandro Russo</a>. Before
    that, I received a Licentiate Degree in Computer Science from the
    <a href="https://unr.edu.ar">National University of Rosario</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently focused on developing reproducible software environments at
    <a href="https://zenseact.com">Zenseact</a>.
    Before that, I worked at <a href="https://dpella.io">DPella</a>, helping
    develop their first pilot solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also write about <a href="/blog">random stuff</a>. Not as much as I'd
    like, though.
