I'm a PhD. student at [Chalmers University of
Technology](https://www.chalmers.se). My research is focused on using functional
programming to improve software testing techniques, especially under the scope
of random testing. I am a member of the [Octopi](https://octopi.chalmers.se)
project, and also a contributor of [QuickFuzz](http://quickfuzz.org).
